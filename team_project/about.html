			<h2>Cooking Classes Project</h2>
			<h4>Project Description </h4>
			<p>This project is a website designed to promote and sell cooking classes. We used current websites from companies such as (PCC, Whisk, and the Pantry) as inspiration to develop a home page, class description page, main, secondary and top navigational elements, a login page, checkout page, and shopping cart.</p>
			<h4>Inspiration</h4>
			<p>The site was inspired by the lead's experience working with a culinary education program at PCC, updating website content, working with the staff and selling classes. There were multiple opportunities to improve layout, design and functionality and we want to attempt the process. PCC, Whisk and the Pantry websites were also used as a guide to the development.
</p>
			<h4>Site Purpose</h4>
			<p>The site is designed to display the available classes on the homepage, provide more class information on the class description page along with the ability to register, and allow users to purchase the classes from the cart and checkout. One of the goals is to be somewhat simplistic in design and require minimal page transitions and clicking. These sites can be a bit overwhelming in content and the goal is to allow filtering and searching on the homepage to narrow down content for quick consumption. Customers should be able to filter by content, category, date, time and day of the week, etc. There is a log in page, however the profile and account module is not complete.</p>
			<h4>Intended Audience</h4>
			<p>The intended audience is folks who enjoy cooking or are looking for a fun activity to engage in. The demographics would include children for kids classes as well as adults in various ages - young adults 20-30, older adults 30-45, and older. </p>
			<h4>Features</h4>
			<p>The site features a homepage that displays available cooking classes, a class description page with more details and registration options, a login page, a shopping cart, a checkout page and FAQs page. It allows users to browse, filter, and purchase classes in a simple uncluttered site.</p>
			<h4>Service Provided</h4>
			<p>This site makes it easy for all users to find and register for cooking classes by offering filters like date, time, and category. The simple layout and minimal clicks help users quickly find what they are looking for, whether they are beginners or experienced cooks.</p>
			<h4>Relevance</h4>
			<p>Cooking classes are a popular way for people to learn new skills, connect with others, and enjoy offline activities. This site supports that by offering a new, user friendly way to explore and sign up for local cooking experiences.</p>
			<h2>Team Member Contributions</h2>
			<h4>Ian Finley</h4>
			<p>Ian contributed through assignment coordination and site standardization. He focused on correcting inconsistencies and creating uniformity through a global navigation in the header and a standardized footer to clarify navigation and to follow Site Improve standards. He was drawn to the project because it sounded like a fun idea and would be a good chance to see how a team of developers work to bring a website together.</p>
			<h4>Dhruv Avadhanam</h4>
			<p>Dhruv tackled most of the technical javascript elements, creating functional forms and site filters for the site. He also contributed an account creation and log in page, in addition to a class list/description page for classes which the site does not currently using but would likely be incorporated in future iterations. He is a valuable team member, frequently willing to jump on assignments and complete them early. He was drawn to this project as he enjoys cooking with his family and was interested in the idea of making a website on this topic.</p>
			<h4>Yuval Amitay</h4>
			<p>Yuval created several site pages including our shopping cart, FAQ's, and validations page. She also contributed in iterations and debugged many pages. She was drawn to the project because she really likes making small things enjoyable, she loved the idea of making cooking more active and engaging, so she was interested in working on this project. 
</p>
			<h4>Deena Randolph</h4>
			<p>Deena led the project providing direction and assigning tasks as required. Her focus was on compiling all the essential elements of the site, facilitating meetings, and maintaining the project pages as needed. Her inspiration was from working with cooking classes and interacting with PCC's website with a desire to recreate and improve on some of the features found there.
